  Basic Usage
 =============
 
 1. Configuration:
 
 The LocalConfig.m file contains paths to folders used to store Osiris analysis files. Ass paths to scan here, or use
 full path when accessing files from the main class object. See below.
 
 
 2. Initialising:
 
 The main class of the toolbox is the OsirisData class. To get started, create an OsirisData object.
 
    od = OsirisData;
    
 Initiating the object will generate a list of subfolders in the data folders listed in LocalConfig.m. To select one of
 these folders, set the PathID value.
 
    od.PathID = 5;
    
 Alternatively, the path can be set directly
 
    od.Path = '/foo/bar';
    
 After a valid path is set, the class will search the root of the folder looking for the input deck. It will look for
 any suitable file within size and file name parameters, and will ask if there are more than one possible candidate. It
 will ignore files with .out, .e, and .tags extensions.
 
 When the input deck has been found or selected, it will be scanned and an OsirisConfig object will be created
 containing the variables in the input deck. The struct of config variables are available as od.Config.Variables, and
 the raw scanned data is accessible through od.Config.Raw.
 
 
 3. Plotting:
 
 Most plot functions take the OsirisData object as first input, and the timestep as second if applicable.
 
 
 4. Key assumptions made by the tool about data structure:
 
 The tool assumes all species are denoted with [Particle]Beam or Plasma[Particle] in the input deck and therefore also
 as files. Examples: PlasmaElectrons, PlasmaIons, ProtonBeam, ElectronBeam, etc.

 
 5. Shorthand variable inputs
 
 Functions accept a set of shorthand codes for the different beams. For instance EB = ElectronBeam, PB = ProtonBeam.
 These are not case sensitive.
 
 Functions also accept text representations of time dumps like Start, End, PStart, PEnd. The former two representing the
 start and the end of the simulation, and the latter two representing the start and end of the plasma.
